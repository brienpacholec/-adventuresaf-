#### Research Ticket Options

There are multiple ski resorts in the state and some of the resorts require different ski passes to ski there. Some of these options include day passes or packs of passes bought directly through the resort, Ikon passes and Epic passes. The only resort that is on the Epic pass for the 2022-2023 season is Park City which yields are super fun ski town with tons of shops and delicious restaurants. The Ikon pass, however, has a few more options regarding resorts included on the pass. These ski resorts include Alta, Snowbird, Brighton, Solitude (home pass), Snow Basin and Deer Valley. It’s important to compare the cost of getting an Epic or Ikon pass vs. a day pass directly from the resort seeing as prices vary from resort to resort.

#### Check the Weather and Road Conditions

When Salt Lake Valley gets a lot of snow, there are cases where Little Cottonwood Canyon (the canyon leading up to Alta & Snowbird) has been closed due to the significant amount of snowfall. If you're buying your pass within a week or two of your trips, it's always a good plan to check the powder report before buying because some resorts do not offer refunds. In addition, the Utah Department of Transportation requires ALL vehicles travelling in Big and Little Cottonwood canyons to be equipped with approved snow tires October 1st through April 30th.  Approved tires are identified with an M+S (mud and snow) or a Snowflake symbol on the sidewall of the tire.

#### Have a Plan for the Mountain

Resorts have different difficulty levels so it's a good idea to check the map and make a plan to get the most out of your trip. Some resorts are quite vast and only yield certain difficulty levels for different areas on the mountain so it’s important to be mindful before your visit. In addition, parking can be limited for certain resorts so be sure to leave early and have a good idea of where you plan to park your vehicle.

#### Get to the Canyon Early and Avoid Traffic

Getting to the mountain as early as you can will help alleviate some of the travel pressure especially when driving up Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons, seeing as traffic usually gets backed up at the mouth of the canyon by 7am. In addition, parking can be scarce if you do not get an early start on the morning so planning ahead can be extremely helpful to limiting traffic and getting a good spot.

#### Avoid Holiday Weekends (if possible)

This is self-explanatory but any trip to Utah ski resorts on the holiday weekend is going to be crawling with crowds. If you plan to ski on a holiday weekend, set your expectations and be prepared to share the mountain.

#### Shred on

Skiing in Utah is an experience in it of itself and will yield memories that will last a lifetime. It’s important to take everything in stride (the good and the bad) and to stay in the moment. Have fun. Be safe. And remember to leave no trace!
