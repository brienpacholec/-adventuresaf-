Rocky Mountain National Park is one of our nation's most spectacular national parks with 415sq. miles of dramatic beauty, high rugged mountains, sparkling lakes, 350 miles of hiking trails, and abundant wildlife. While here you can enjoy quiet walks, exhilarating hikes, gorgeous sunrises and sunsets, wildlife watching, scenic drives, horesback rides, rock climbing, photography, backpacking, and so much more. You are also likely to meet some of the locals: elk, bighorn sheep, moose, marmots, pika, and many other wild creatures that call this park home.
